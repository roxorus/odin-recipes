    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pho got its start in northern Vietnam around the beginning of the
      twentieth century. The exact circumstances are unclear, but Vietnam’s
      signature noodle soup resulted from cultures rubbing shoulders. There are
      many theories about the original pho but one good explanation points to a
      glut of beef parts – bones, offal, and tough cuts leftover from French
      colonialists slaughtering cows for their tender steaks. Locals were
      enjoying a water buffalo-based rice vermicelli noodle soup.
    </p>
    <p>
      Street vendors began tweaking their water buffalo soup by using beef and
      changing the rice noodles from round ones to the flat ones you see today.
      Such old-school pho with delicate broth, rice noodles, and thin slices of
      cooked beef is wonderful but over time, vendors and diners dolled things
      up with lots of add-ins (herbs, condiments, vegetables!). Cue slices of
      raw beef. And when beef wasn’t available, people made pho with chicken.
      From there, cooks got creative and now there are pho banh mi, cocktails,
      dumplings, cookbooks, and more!

      <li>1 white (daikon) radish, sliced</li>
      <li>2 ounces whole star anise pods</li>
      <li>½ (3 inch) cinnamon stick</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon black peppercorns</li>
      <li>2 whole cloves</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>

      <li>1 ½ pounds dried flat rice noodles</li>
      <li>½ pound frozen beef sirloin</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Cook and stir ground beef, onion, and garlic in a large skillet over
        medium heat for 5 minutes; drain fat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make broth: Place beef bones in a 9-quart (or larger) pot; season with 1
        teaspoon salt. Pour water into the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat
        and simmer broth for about 2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and
        preheat the oven's broiler. Line a 10x15-inch roasting pan with aluminum
        foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place onions and unpeeled ginger onto the prepared roasting pan and cook
        under the preheated broiler, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are
        charred, 10 to 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cool slightly. Chop onions, then peel and slice ginger; set aside
        separately.
      </li>
      <li>
        Skim fat from surface of simmering broth. Add oxtail, radish, and
        charred onions to broth. Tie charred ginger, anise, cinnamon stick,
        peppercorns, and cloves in cheesecloth to make a bouquet garni; add to
        broth. Stir in sugar, fish sauce, and remaining 2 teaspoons salt. Simmer
        over medium-low heat for at least 4 hours (the longer, the better).
        Season with salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Strain broth. Discard bones and bouquet garni. Reserve meat from bones
        for another use. Chill broth in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Skim and discard fat from the top of chilled broth. Pour broth into a
        pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and keep hot until ready to serve.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a pot of water to a boil. Turn off heat. Stir in rice noodles and
        let sit until noodles are tender yet chewy, 6 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Meanwhile, cut frozen sirloin into paper-thin slices.</li>

      <li>
        Drain and divide noodles among bowls, about 1 1/2 cups per serving. Top
        each with a few sirloin slices. Ladle hot broth over sirloin and
        noodles.
      </li>
      <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
